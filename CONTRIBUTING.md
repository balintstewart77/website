# How to contribute?

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. üéâ

In this repository, we use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/) that help us recognise all contributors, even when they don't directly contribute on the repository.
You can find all [emoji/Type keywords](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) representing the types of contribution.
To add a contributor, comment on Issue or Pull Request (where the contributor is involved) using this message for @all-contributors:
`@all-contributors please add @<username> for <keyword in the Type column>`

Whatever your availability, there is a way to contribute to the UK-TRE repo!

## üëã I'm busy, I only have 5 minutes

## üõ† I am ready to contribute

- For open tasks in this repository, please see the [Issues section](../../issues).
- Raise mistakes, errors or missing information on this repository by opening a [Pull Request](../../pulls)
  - Read details on [how to open a Pull Request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request)
  - Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
  - Start work on a contribution that is already listed as an issue or something you‚Äôve already discussed
  - A Pull Request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. It‚Äôs usually better to open a Pull Request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress.
    Just mark it as a ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (Work in Progress) in the subject line and [open it as a draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests).
    You can always add more commits later.
