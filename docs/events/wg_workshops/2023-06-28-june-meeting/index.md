## Breakout rooms possible topics

- Steps towards a shared understanding for TREs
- How to bring more members of the public into this community
- Anonymisation of / working with unstructured text in TREs

## Notes

### Introduction

- Is RSE Con hybrid?
  - Currently mornings are but figuring out how to facilitate other sessions

### Working group update notes

- Funding / Sustainability WG:

  - Putting together position paper on behalf of UK TRE Community
  - Collecting use-cases for TREs
  - Cost recovery models - see access policy for cost recovery model (cohort study): http://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/alspac/documents/researchers/data-access/ALSPAC_Access_Policy.pdf - cost recovery is based on operating costs of data access team

- Information Governance:
  - Meeting on 6th June: discussed IG standards i.e. ingress/egress processes, risk tiering, aligning with existing standards

#### Questions and comments

- Is this community then trying to define what a TRE is?
  - 5 safes have helped regulatory standards i.e in NHS - but they are a bit vague
- If anyone has knowledge of cost recovery models for TREs - please get in contact with Fergus from DARE

#### Community announcements

- SATRE Project - DARE funded project to bring to together a community-led standard for TRE architecture. We welcome new community members :smiley:
  - You are all invited to our collaboration cafes - [Schedule Here](https://hackmd.io/GI5EZQouTYuGhkYBSBYHmQ)
