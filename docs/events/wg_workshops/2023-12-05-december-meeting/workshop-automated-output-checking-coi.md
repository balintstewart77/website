# Evaluation of Automated Output Checking and AI Model Risk Assessment Community of Interest

**Leads**: Jim Smith (University of the West of England), Jackie Caldwell (PHS)

## Summary

The session is intended to give an over view of the Community of Interest on automated risk assessment.
This naturally includes the risk assessment of AI models, since this is not something that can be done manually.

The aim is to:
(1) introduce the Community of Interest group, and its aim of reducing barriers to adoption of (semi) automated checking,
(2) make some proposals about how we plan to move forward on this alongside UK-TRE,
(3) to get feedback from people present about and how they would like to se the community develop and work

## Preparation

No required preparation beyond an open mind!

If people would like some perspective on where the project has evolved from, it might be useful to skim-read the first 5-6 pages of [the SACRO project's final report](https://zenodo.org/records/10055365)

But **please note** this Community of Interest has a broader remit than just SACRO - for example, by design we include projects such as DataShield, as well as other approaches for assessing ML privacy leakage.

## Target audience

No specific target audience in mind - anybody interested!
