# The role of standards for provenance and metadata in federated TRE architectures

**Chair**: TBA

## Prompts

- What metadata do you provide to researchers about data released to them?
- Do you conform to any existing standards of metadata when providing to researchers? Which standards?
- Do you utilise any metadata standards when publishing data externally? Which standards?
- Do you share/publish code with researchers? Why or why not?
- What are barriers to tracking and sharing provenance and metadata between organisations? What are ways to improve this?
- Outputs produced by technical solutions for provenance tracking might be inaccessible to non-technical decision makers. What can we do to address this?
- To what extent are rights/licence/access-conditions currently described _formally_ in metadata?
