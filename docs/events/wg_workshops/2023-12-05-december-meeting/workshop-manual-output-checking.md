# Streamlining manual output checking
**Lead:** Rachael Williams (MHRA)

## Summary

This workshop will bring the community together to brainstorm strategies and tools for streamlining manual output checking in TREs. 

Whilst automated output checking is going some way to minimising bottlenecks, manual verification is seen by many as a crucial step in maintaining confidentiality and in making sure that outputs align with the intentions of individual projects. 
This manual step can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

Participants will brainstorm effective techniques for optimising this process, including best practices to enhance efficiency without compromising governance.

By the end of the workshop, it is hoped that participants will be equipped with practical insights to enhance the speed and accuracy of manual output checking, ultimately improving the overall research workflow.

## Preparation
Please bring your experience, ideas, and questions, around what works and what doesn’t in the world of manual output checking, such as checklist development, collaborative workflows, and quality assurance measures.

## Target audience
All involved in manual output checking – both from a policy and procedures perspective, and with hands on experience.
