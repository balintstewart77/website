# Multi-TRE analysis : can a common governance model breaks data silos?

**Chair**: Fatemeh Torabi (Swansea University)

## Prompts

Work from Swansea Unversity has shown that major UK TREs are operating on different governance models ([Torabi et al. 2023](https://ijpds.org/article/view/2164)).
This breakout will discuss whether and how a common governance model can be achieved.

- What percentage of the problem of data silos will be solved by a common governance model?
- What can be incorporated in a common governance model, and what can't?
- How do governance models need to be updated to work for a multi-TRE network, rather than just individual TREs?
