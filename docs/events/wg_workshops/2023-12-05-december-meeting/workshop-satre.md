# SATRE next steps

**Lead:** Chris Cole (University of Dundee)

## Summary

After extensive community engagement often in conjunction with UK TRE, the first version of the SATRE Specification was launched in October.
It is by no means finished, but it is now stable and ready for use.

This current phase of the SATRE journey to "kick the tyres" and use the evaluation process to either assess your TRE, if you have one, or use it test your assumptions/knowledge of TREs.
SATRE was created quickly and there will be parts that can be improved.

Today is a chance to find out more of the continuing plans for SATRE within the UK TRE Community, contribute and ask questions.
