# TRE Federation: appetite for a standards working group(s)?

**Chair**: Rob Baxter (DARE UK)

## Prompts

Federating TREs to enable linked-data research is a big topic, with lots of current activity.
DARE UK have tried, in the spirit of George Box[^1], to draw the current threads together into a common architecture.
But what next? Forming a community working group to develop the architecture and technical standards seems like a good thing to do.

- How much enthusiasm is there to form a WG? Assuming there is someâ€¦
- What should its scope be? Infrastructure standards? Query standards? Data? Governance?
- What starting points make sense? DARE UK architecture (v 2.0 coming soon)? Current tech ideas?
- What outputs would we aim for, on what timescales?
- How best would we organise and collaborate? Docs on GH webpages, with issues, boards etc? Something else?
