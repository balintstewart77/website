# SDE/TRE Definitions

**Lead**: Madalyn Hardaker (KCL)

## Proposal

### Summary

The UK TRE Working Group on SDE/ TRE Definitions has recently developed a draft scope and output report framework [available here](https://github.com/FrancisCrickInstitute/UK_TRE/tree/main/SDE%20TRE%20Definitions%20Working%20Group).

Initial discussions have generally agreed SDEs and TREs are different, but views on how and the extent to which they differ are varied. The working group released a survey in February [available here](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=B3jtTq3rWkGnqZFwlH9OrugHht_C0ZhBkdNS6wqs4JxUMkRWNldaMTFFUVIwTUEyMVBaRzhBT0UzNC4u) to gather more information about the communityâ€™s views and would like to provide an interim update at this meeting.

### Required preparation

It would be very useful if everyone completed the survey in question - [available here](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=B3jtTq3rWkGnqZFwlH9OrugHht_C0ZhBkdNS6wqs4JxUMkRWNldaMTFFUVIwTUEyMVBaRzhBT0UzNC4u)

### Target audience

All are welcome
