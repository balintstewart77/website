# TRE at King’s: Deployment & Egress Simulation

**Lead**: Michal Rosiek (KCL)

## Proposal

### Summary

The session will be a brief PowerPoint presentation followed by an egress simulation.

The PowerPoint presentation will encompass:

- Blueprint of our TRE design
- Automated deployment process
- Ensuring secure ingress & egress
- Access control mechanisms
- Development timeline overview
- Current metrics update

In the egress simulation, we will cover:

- Demonstrating secure login procedures to TRE project resources
- Highlighting distinctions among resources
- Explaining directory structures
- Simulating secure ingress with approval from egress authority groups

This session is intended to benefit both TRE owners/developers and researchers by providing insights into how we tailor our TRE to meet project needs and expectations.

### Required preparation

I suggest that anyone interested familiarize themselves with our TRE webpage, which contains comprehensive information, including diagrams of the architecture and a video showcasing the user experience.

### Target audience

This session is open to anyone interested in both using and deploying TRE.
