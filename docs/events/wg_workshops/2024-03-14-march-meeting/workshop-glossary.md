# Glossary working group scoping

**Lead**: Rob Baxter (DARE UK)

## Proposal

### Summary

Glossary (noun); an alphabetical list of words relating to a specific subject, text, or dialect, with explanations; a brief dictionary.

There’s been anecdotal interest in a shared glossary across the TRE space. 
There are also plenty of existing ones out there. 
At risk of turning into an XKCD cartoon, the suggestion is to bring a number of them together, merging and reconciling as appropriate, and hosting at uktre.org. 
Questions we should ponder:
- Which ones?
- How to we manage change?
- How do we reconcile conflicts?
 

### Required preparation

[Over here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qublBBkpYpNgwKm5HPFD1F7WPvaYaBpY/edit#gid=1421062944) is a first pass, bringing together two glossaries from DataMind and the DARE UK Driver Project Programme 2023. 
Take a look if you’ve time. 

Couple of remarks: each was quite extensive, and the overlap between them was only around 2%; each has “project-” or “technology-specific” terms – should we drop terms like this?

### Target audience

Anyone who’s interested in harmonising the terms we use across the community space.
