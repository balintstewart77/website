# Breakout sessions

We are planning several breakout sessions on topics suggested by attendees, with topics chosen by attendees on the day.

## Suggested topics

Some topics have already been submitted:

- Federation of cross-discipline TREs - current technology pros, cons, gaps? Break Multi-TRE analysis: challenges, governance requirements, federation.
- Current state of the art re data linkage/federation/AI&ML&LLM across infrastructures which do not allow (large scale) data to move Governance around advanced analysis i.e. AI/ML, Data federation, Safe output methods
- TRE sustainability and operations. TRE operating models & federation
- Safety and security of Python and R package import into TREs. Domain-specific vs general-purpose TREs?
- Community-based efforts and collaborations in public involvement and engagement. The role of TRE standards for the TRE community.
- The role of independent TRE providers in relation to the NHS national and regional SDEs. Cloud vs on-prem TREs: costs, constraints, pros & cons
- Sight unseen: how far can we go with keeping data hidden from users? Addressing data harmonisation between different datasets: do TREs have a role?
- Access and rights metadata to support process choreography and interoperability (e.g. generic researcher applications and authorization). International challenges and lessons on federating data access

Additional topics can be suggested via this form: TODO
and on the day

## Breakout session format

Each breakout session will be one hour long, with multiple parallel topics decided by a vote prior to the session:

```{list-table}

  - Vote for breakout 1 topics
- - 14:15 - 15:15

- - 16:30 - 16:45
  - Break
- - 16:45 - 17:15
  - Conclusions, actions and next steps: Breakout groups present their next steps
```

We will attempt to cover as many topics as possible, and attendees can choose which breakout session to go to.
Popular topics will be covered in both sessions, giving participants the options of going much more in-depth.

At the end of this session we would like each group to summarise their next steps in 2 minutes: what they want to achieve, what resources they require, and how they will go about it.
