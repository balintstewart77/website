### Background

The UK TRE community is thrilled to announce what is hoped to be the UK's largest in-person meeting on Trusted Research Environments (TREs) to be held in Swansea on Monday 4th September 2023.
The day will bring together stakeholders from all sectors and disciplines to discuss the current state of TREs, look at existing barriers, and define the future provision of TREs in the UK.

The UK TRE Community is a community that has grown organically over the last year for anyone interested in TREs, including researchers, operators, information governors and managers and more, from all sectors and disciplines.
The core aims of fostering collaboration and sharing of innovative ideas to support the delivery of groundbreaking research with sensitive data have resonated across the UK and beyond.

### Meeting information

The meeting will focus on how TREs can work together through the development of open standards, codebases and federation to enable sharing of technology and workflows, and will encompass a range of topics including the development of technical and governance standards for TREs, the major challenges of operating TREs today, and how the community can work together to address these and other common challenges.

The meeting is open to everyone, and will be attended by a range of stakeholders including those involved in the day-to-day development and operations of TREs, those responsible for commissioning and funding TREs, and users of TREs from the health, administrative and industry sectors.

### Agenda

The day will feature lightning talks from cross-sector research industry teams who are at the forefront of testing innovative ideas for TREs, and a keynote presentation on HDR UK’s plans for the tech eco-system.

A key part of the day will be breakout sessions and discussions where we will take advantage of the mix of sectors and stakeholders to learn from each other, evaluate the work already done, and define goals for the community and the future provision of TREs in the UK and beyond over the next few years.

This meeting is open to everyone and free to attend, thanks to the sponsorship by The Alan Turing Institute, HDR UK and DARE UK. The morning talks will also be broadcast online for those that cannot attend in person, but all afternoon sessions including breakout discussions will be in-person only.

## Notes from the day

- Key questions
  - What's stopping TREs from working together?
  - What's actuallu happenign in the TRE space?
  - What can TRE teams do together?
  - What support can the UK TRE Community provide to help TREs work together?
  - (What's missing?)

### Keynote

Can convening a technology ecosystem help TREs to work together? by Emily Jefferson (CTO, HDR UK)

- Goal to make it easier for accredited researchers to access data across TREs.
- Four pillars:
  - Technology services ecosystem
  - Trust and transparency
  - Usable data
  - Capacity building (RSEs a key aspect of this)
- Driver programmes focussed on answering research questions but with a brief to do so in a way that contributes to the collective pool of technology and approaches
- Common challenges / pipeline elements across TREs / projects, but little re-use / shared use.

- Convening a technology ecosystem
  - Community, People, Beyond Health, Standards for Interoperability, Science of Infrastructure
    - How can HDR UK support this?
    - HDR's Technician Commitment - what's a better name?
    - Recognising non-traditional careers including RSEs
    - Supporting a wide range of impact - not just academic publications
    - Technical solutions but for health need to work for non-health, too. People who work with sensitive data - health or not -> DARE UK
    - Help us develop standards - OMOP, but what else?
    - Innovative infrastructure which is making an important contribution - recognising impact.
  - Technological Solutions
    - Solutions from across the community
    - HDR UK will also contribute some technological solutions supporting the ecosystem - all being open sourced. Not about mandating, but about having something available for all to use / build on.
  - "The Gateway" to signpost and connect things across the community and include some common core elements.
    - e.g. Metadata dictionary, Cohort discovery, Data discovery, Data use register, Data use requests
    - Mk2 Gateway: Brandable by others, interoperable, modular, community developed, re-use existing solutions / components, driven by use case exemplars, open APIs, automated, scalable
